## Introduction :

Hi !

`lxctn.com` is my personal website and showcase some of my work.
At the same time, it's a demo of my young experience as a web developer :
It's a `react` app using `redux`, `react-router`, `framer-motion`, and trying to respect all good practices for **readability**, **maintainability**, **reusability**, **scalability**, **performance** and **security** of the code, but also **`HTML` sementic**, **accessibility**, **seo**, **ux**, etc.

Feel free to fork and play with !
